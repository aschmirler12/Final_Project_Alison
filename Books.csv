Stankard;Ulysses Grant Dietz;1996.0;Harry N Abrams;10;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0810944731.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0810944731.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0810944731.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg;Since childhood, nature has always been important to Paul Stankard, and now as the world's leading glass paperweight artist, this interest has become the defining signature of his work. Flowers such as roses, lilacs, and orchids are depicted as are a host of fantasy flowers that the artist creates in his studio, located in southern New Jersey. To look at a Stankard paperweight is to be momentarily fooled into believing that the artist has preserved a living flower in glass, when, in fact, he has created one entirely from spun filaments. Words, too, play a role, again reinforcing natural processes. Here the artist creates mosaic word canes, spelling out words like seed, wet, and scent, to name a few, which he then embeds in his floral creations. A more complex application of Stankard's paperweight skill is the formation of what the artist calls botanicals, which are upright cloistered glass objects, sometimes in diptych and triptych formations. In Paul Stankard: Homage to Nature, decorative arts curator Ulysses Grant Dietz writes with ease and affection about this gregarious, immensely talented artist. More than 180 photographs by fine arts photographer John Bigelow Taylor display close to 200 paperweights and botanicals made by Paul Stankard. Also included are photographs showing the actual preparation and assembly of the flowers, root people, and insects encased in glass. No other glass art book has ever shown a glass artist's process of creation as it is depicted here.

Whether you are opening Free to Be . . . You and Me for the first time or the one hundredth time you will be engaged and transformed by this newly beautifully illustrated compilation of inspirational stories, songs, and poems. The sentiments of thirty-five years ago are as relevant today as when this book was published. Celebrating individuality and challenging stereotypes empowers both children and adults with the freedom to be who they want to be and to have compassion and empathy for others who may be different. Working closely with Marlo and co-creator Carole Hart, Peter H. Reynolds, the New York Times Best Selling Children's Book Author/Illustrator, conjured his whimsical drawings throughout the book bringing a new sense of unity and warmth to the pages. You will find yourself marveling at the illustrations, nodding in agreement with the stories and poems, and singing the words to all the classic songs! It is wonderful that the thoughts, ideas, and emotions the creators envisioned so many years ago can still have a magical effect on children today.

There was the Chanel of the most sumptuous baroque, of dazzling, playful, unrestrained jewelry, of diamonds and emeralds shimmering like stars, and there was the Chanel of the tailored suit and the little black dress, of the severe cut, the strand of pearls, of classicism à la française. Out of this dialogue between hyperbole and understatement, and in counterpoint to the costume jewelry that she gave to the world, she created jewelry that was unparalleled in its insistence on luxury and refinement and unfettered in its imagination. Her jewelry presents one of the least known aspects of her work. With more than 120 illustrations and based on archival research and interviews with Chanel's colleagues and other witnesses to her life and career.--From publisher description.

The most important field marks of more than 500 species are shown in 350 superb pen-and-ink drawings, which make this benchmark work as beautiful as it is useful. The book is designed as a user-friendly introduction to the natural history of the Chesapeake Bay. Scientific jargon is kept to a minimum. Illustrations and text are paired to present an easy-to-use primer on the estuarine system. The book takes an ecological approach to life above and below the Chesapeake's surface. Wetland and aquatic communities are emphasized.

All of the material presented here is true. Some of it seems unbelievable but all the reports here are covering behaviors that these people were engaging in willingly (even some of the fatal ones) for the purpose of having some sort of heightened sensory experience. Nearly all of this behavior does NOT involve drugs, focusing more on altered experience through altered body state. Not for the easily squeamish. Despite the extreme subject matter, this volume is highly intelligent and an amazing psychological peek into the fringes of human experiences."

Hallucinatory, witty, and sublime, these suburban dioramas are a breathtaking testament to one woman's dazzling mission. Essays by Peter Schjeldahl and Marcia Tucker.
